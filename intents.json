In such a situation, it is possible to launch, for example, rocket launchers by an infected computer used for military purposes, although military networks belong the most secure in all respects. For other networks, e.g. associations between banks, systematic subtraction or addition of specified sums to selected or all accounts may result in financial consequences on a scale global. There are known cases of blackmailing or threatening to introduce paralyzing viruses communication between individual institutions, which in turn resulted in panic fueled by the media."]

Next the virus modifies the FAT file system so that other files are redirected to the sector disk containing the virus code.
